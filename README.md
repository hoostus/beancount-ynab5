# What it does.

*beancount-ynab5* will import **reconciled** transactions from your cloud-based
YNAB5 budget into a beancount file. This allows you to use YNAB5 for its
budgeting, for automatically pulling transactions from various US financial
institutions, and for its mobile app. But you can also sync it to beancount,
which has support for multiple currencies, investments, and other things.

Why only reconciled transactions? This importer doesn't handle updating a transaction
that you've already imported. By waiting until the transaction is reconciled we (hopefully)
avoid situations where we import something that then later gets updated.

# Requirements.

* requests: https://pypi.org/project/requests/
* aiohttp: https://pypi.org/project/aiohttp/

You must have *one* of these installed. You don't need both. If you have
aiohttp installed, then the importer will make parallel requests to YNAB,
which speeds things up somewhat.

The command line options **--enable-async-fetch** and **--disable-async-fetch**
will allow you to override the default behaviour.

# Running it.

When you run the script it will output beancount transactions to stdout. You
probably want to tee it or redirect it to a file.

In order to get access to your YNAB budget you need to have a Personal Access
Token and provide it to the importer on the command line with the **--ynab-token**
option.

## Notes on running it.

You don't actually have to specify a beancount file, it is optional. If no
beancount file is provided, this is equivalent to an empty beancount file.

If you have multiple budgets in YNAB, you *must* specify which one to use. If
you only have a single budget, then this parameter can be omitted.

## Get a Personal Access Token for your YNAB account.

Instructions on how to do this are on [YNAB's API website.](https://api.youneedabudget.com/)

The short version: Go to "My Account" then click on "Developer Settings".

Write down the very long token somewhere. You'll need it later.

## YNAB Rate Limits.

[YNAB enforces rate limits on its API.](https://api.youneedabudget.com/#rate-limiting)

> An access token may be used for up to 200 requests per hour.
> The limit is reset every clock hour. So, if an access token is used at 12:30 PM
> and for 199 more requests up to 12:45 PM and then hits the limit, any additional
> requests will be forbidden until 1:00 PM. At 1:00 PM you would have the full
> 200 requests allowed again, until 2:00 PM.

It shouldn't be an issue in normal usage -- each run of the importer results in
4 HTTP accesses, so you can run it 50 times an hour -- but just FYI.

# Mapping accounts between YNAB and beancount.

The importer needs to map accounts & budget categories between YNAB and beancount.
You have two options.

1. Rely on the default mapping algorithm.
1. Add metadata to the beancount file explicitly mapping accounts.

## The default algorithm.

1. Any punctuation in the YNAB account name is removed. So *Rent/Mortgage* would
    become *RentMortgage*
1. Any spaces get turned into a hyphen. So *Car Insurance* would become
    *Car-Insurance*
1. All YNAB accounts are given the *Assets* prefix.
1. All YNAB budget categories are given the *Expenses* prefix.
1. Budget groups are used as an additional level of hierarchy.

In the default budget category list that means *Rent & Mortgage* in the group
*Immediate Obligations* becomes *Expenses:Immediate-Obligations:RentMortgage*.

Here are a few other examples of the transformation:

1. Expenses:Immediate-Obligations:RentMortgage (*Rent & Mortgage*)
1. Expenses:True-Expenses:RentersHome-Insurance (*Renter's/Home Insurance*)
1. Expenses:Immediate-Obligations:Interest--Fees (*Interest & Fees*)

## Add a ynab-id to your beancount accounts.

It is also possible to perform an explicit mapping. You might do this if you
don't like the default algorithm or if you want beancount and YNAB to have
different structures & naming.

All you need to do is add a **ynab-id** metadata to any account with the value
of the UUID of the YNAB account you want it to map to.

    2016-01-01 open Expenses:Monthly:Phone
        ynab-id: "9a2fb967-974a-4040-a584-0234d1de7abb"

You can mix & match the two approaches. You can add **ynab-id** to some accounts
but rely on the default algorithm for other accounts.

How do you get that UUID? By using the importer's **--list-ynab-ids** mode.

    > python ynab.py --token $TOKEN my.beanfile --list-ynab-ids
    2e092108-4065-44a3-875e-db77fc2bc48f Just for Fun:Dining Out
                                         Expenses:Everyday:Restaurants
    [...repeats...]

This will list the UUID, the YNAB account, and the associated beancount account
(if any). If there is no beancount account associated with that UUID yet then
*(none)* will be displayed instead, as in this example:

    > python ynab.py --token $TOKEN my.beanfile --list-ynab-ids
    f7aa4b9e-7fa4-4294-a5ec-ded5a54f5ff2 Just for Fun:Fun Money
                                         (none)

# Skipping 'Starting Balance' statements in YNAB.

YNAB will generate Starting Balance statements that are, essentially, income
from nowhere.

    2019-10-04 * "Starting Balance" 
        ynab-id: "b79660e1-6554-4dae-97be-9bf7b04764f3"
        Assets:Checking                                    5,000 USD
        Income:Internal-Master-Category:Inflows

In many cases, you won't want to import these transaction. You may have an
existing beancount history that accounts for the current value of the account.
This transaction would *double* the value of the account and throw it out of
balance.

You can skip these "Starting Balance" statements during the import by specifying
the command line option **--skip-starting-balances**.

# Income.

The biggest disconnect between YNAB and beancount is how they handle income.
YNAB doesn't differentiate between different sources of income. They are all just
"income". Salary, interest, dividends...they are all just income as far as YNAB
is concerned.

That means the importer will place all income into a single category. By default
it will all go into **Income:Internal-Master-Category:Inflows**.

At the moment, the importer doesn't do anything smart to help you out. If you
don't want all of your income to go into a single category, then you will
need to manually edit the resulting import statements.

## Reconciling.

When you reconcile in YNAB, if your cleared balance and your working balance
don't match up you can select "Create Adjustment & Finish". If you do this,
YNAB will generate a transaction that will cause your cleared balance and
working balance to match up. The transaction will look something like this:

    2019-10-07 * "Reconciliation Balance Adjustment" "Entered automatically by YNAB"
        ynab-id: "76972f80-1374-48ec-b28d-8b309900f976"
        Assets:Wallet                                        -12 USD
        Income:Internal-Master-Category:Inflows

In particular, notice that the transaction is generated against your income.
This is unlikely to be what you want to happen if you are using beancount.

A better course is to create an additional transaction that will make the
cleared balance and working balance match. For instance, create a transaction
in YNAB that assigns $12 to a "Miscellaneous" expense.

You can also automatically remap this to another account by using the
**--balance-adjustment-account** command line option.

# YNAB's Off Budget (aka Tracking) Accounts.

YNAB allows you to have Tracking accounts, that aren't part of its normal
budgeting workflow. These are useful for things like Mortgages or Certificates of Deposit.
Some transactions in Tracking accounts will only have a single "leg". This is a
problem because beancount's double-entry bookkeeping requires everything to have
(at least) two legs.

In this scenario, we don't have enough information to generate a valid beancount
entry. A warning will be displayed on-screen, giving you some information about
where to locate the problem. Additionally, the imported data will fail bean-check
with a "Transaction does not balance" error.

You will need to manually edit the imported data and fix this.

# TODOs.

* YNAB comes with several special accounts. I've only seen the Inflows one used.
    So I'm not sure what's up with the others.
    * Internal Master Category:Inflows
    * Internal Master Category:Deferred Income SubCategory
    * Internal Master Category:Uncategorized
* YNAB creates a special category for credit card payments
    (e.g. *Credit Card Payments:Timo Mastercard*). I haven't looked into how
    exactly that works.
* Implement something automagic for Inflows? A way to map based on *payee* to
    different beancount Income accounts?
